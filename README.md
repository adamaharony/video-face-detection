# video-face-detection
This is a Python3 script that uses the mathematical principles of Haar cascades and Haar wavelets to detect faces and eyes within a live video stream from the camera.


## This project was an 'Python Image and AI Algorithms' w/ Dr. Dmitry Goldstein end-of-course project in the Holon Institute of Technology (HIT), by me and by @maorv64
